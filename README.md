ofxKuKinectV2
=============

An Kuflex's addon for the Kinect V2 sensor. 
It's fork of original ofxKinectV2 addon https://github.com/ofTheo/ofxKinectV2 by Theo Watson,
which is based on the excellent work by the https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2 team (@JoshBlake @floe and @christiankerl plus others) 

We made this fork to have addon tuned for our (Kuflex) purposes:
- Easy install and work in Windows
- Allows to disable RGB capture
- Allows to get point cloud
- Uses OpenGL based decoding by default
- Supports multiple kinects. 

Notes:
- Requires a USB 3 port on machine.
